### How to configure GCP Project and get create `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` values

You need [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) Project to
develop this app.

- First go to [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a
  project.
- Then go to `APIs & Services`.
- Enable Calendar API from `+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES` link.

- In `OAuth consent screen` tab, set up the project's consent screen.
- In `Credentials` tab, create `OAuth client ID` with `Web application` type.
- TODO(kt3k): document the parameters to set.
- Then you'll find client id and client secret of the oauth client.
- Copy those values and set them as `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.

For Deno Land employees:

- You can find these values in `Meet Me API Credentials` section in the password
  manager.
